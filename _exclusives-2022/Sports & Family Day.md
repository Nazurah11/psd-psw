# Sports & Family Day

The Sports & Family Day is organised by the Civil Service Club and will make a comeback this year after a two-year hiatus. The event aims at promoting a healthy lifestyle and fostering camaraderie amongst public service officers. The event will be held at the Gardens By The Bay East (11 Rhu Cross) on 30 July 2022. The activities include Inter-Agency sporting events, such as a Public Service Telematch and an Amazing Race, sports try-outs for officers to try their hand in, and a host of family and fringe activities to engage all participants and promote family bonding. Do watch this space for the details!
