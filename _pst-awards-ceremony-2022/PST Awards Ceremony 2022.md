The Public Service Transformation Awards is the Whole-of-Government (WOG) pinnacle platform that recognises efforts at the WOG, agency, and individual levels and rewards officers and agencies for excellence in service delivery, innovation, and organisational practices. 

The Awards constitute a key culture-shaping lever, through spurring officers and agencies to pursue PST, showcasing best practices for inspiration across the Public Service, and recognising behaviours that reflect the PST Outcomes:

**One Public Service, Trusted, with Citizens at the Centre**
Exemplary efforts at the WOG or cross-agency level, which involve officers working across agency lines in new ways to help citizens and businesses, and which involve co-creation or co-delivery with the people and private sectors

**Lean, Agile, Digital**
Exemplary efforts particularly in two areas at the agency level: business transformation and workforce transformation

**With Skilled and Adaptable Leaders and Officers**
Outstanding officers who display desired traits and behaviours e.g. (i) being innovative; and (ii) being grounded and recognise transformative directors and middle managers who drive excellent service, innovation and change in their teams, by nurturing them to be innovative and adaptable

**Leading Globally in Service Delivery and Innovation**
Outstanding service delivery at the individual and agency levels
