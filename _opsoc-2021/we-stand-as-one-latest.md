### We Stand as One
<br>
We reached out and they answered. Their words of encouragement are specially for YOU!<br>
<br>
Fellow officers submitted their videos to rally the public service to stand in solidarity as One. These teams stand to win vouchers worth up to $400. YOU get to decide the winner!<br>
<br>
The winning 5 entries will be showcased ‘live’ during the pre-event segment of OPSOC 2021. Register for OPSOC here.<br>
<br>
Cast your votes by liking the videos on the “[WOG] FYI” Workplace page here by 9am on 9 July.
