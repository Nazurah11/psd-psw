###Give a Gift!<br>
<br>
In our eventful journey as Public Officers, our paths tend to cross with colleagues across various public agencies as we engage in meaningful collaborations and work relations to deliver the best outcome to the public.<br>
<br>
Ever wanted to send them more than a ‘Thank you’ email? What better way to show your appreciation to colleagues from another agency than through meaningful gifts! But… when’s the best time?<br>
<br>
There are gift-giving celebrations such as Mothers’ Day, Christmas Day and Valentines’ Day but have you ever heard of Inter-Agency Gifting Day? This Public Service Week, as part of the One Public Service Observance Ceremony, we offer you just that – an occasion to “Give a Gift”!<br>
<br>
Our selection of gifts is fit for that discerning colleague and at the same time, you get to support a local Social Service Organisation. Look no further for a fine selection of gifting options from social enterprises such as Foreword Coffee, Bizlink Gifts, and Yellow Ribbon Industries!<br>
