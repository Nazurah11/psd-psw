### About
The One Public Service Observance Ceremony is an annual platform for officers to recommit and reinforce our purpose as public officers to do our best in service to our nation.<br>

This year, we are continuing with the successful virtual format! Join us in this mega ceremony for all public officers as we come together to reflect over the past one year and look ahead to the coming year.<br>
