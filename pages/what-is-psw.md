### What is Public Service Week?


The theme for Public Service Week 2022 is 'Be The New'.<br>
<br>
It is a call for officers to uncover their hidden traits and unleash new aspects of
themselves that will redefine the
meaning of work and awaken their sense
of purpose.
<br>
<br>
The new normal is no longer new –
disruptions and braving uncertainties
together have become our way of life.

What's new, is within you.

New mindsets, competencies and
perspectives.
Enabling you to experiment boldly,
work differently and grow with diversity.
<br>

Let's build on our good work and build each other up.

It's time to Be The New______. And what’s new, is up to you.<br>
