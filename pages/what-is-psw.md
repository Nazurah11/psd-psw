### What is Public Service Week

The theme for Public Service Week 2021 is Emerging Stronger as One Public Service.<br>
<br>
Even as we continue the battle to keep the pandemic at bay, we need to also look ahead and seize opportunities to rebuild our economy, society and people for a post-COVID-19 world. While COVID-19 is the challenge of a generation, many opportunities for transformation have also arisen from this crisis that we can take hold of to improve the lives of Singaporeans.<br>
<br>
Together, we will emerge stronger as One Public Service.<br>
<br>
PSW2021 will be held virtually. <br>
