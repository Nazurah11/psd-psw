### What is Public Service Week

The theme for Public Service Week 2021 is <b>Emerging Stronger as One Public Service</b>. <br>
<br>
2020 had been a trying year for us. Through everyone's effort, sacrifice and perseverance, we have kept the pandemic under control in Singapore. <br>
<br>
2021 will be a major turning point for us as we are facing new challenges and seizing new opportunities as we rebuild our economy, society and people in the post-COVID-19 world. We can stay agile and build on the opportunities for transformation that have arisen due to COVID-19, and continue to improve the lives of Singaporeans.<br>
<br>
Together, we will emerge stronger as One Public Service.<br>
<br>
<br>

PSW2021 will be held virtually via Zoom Webinar. <br>
